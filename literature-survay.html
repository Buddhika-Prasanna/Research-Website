                    <p class="text-justify">With the evolution of Internet technology people have the trend of using internet services to
                        get their ornaments. When it comes to the marketing, most of the market places are converted
                        as ecommerce platforms where goods and services are offered through the internet. Even
                        though there are number of ecommerce recommendation platforms available, the owners are
                        struggling on the personalized product suggestions for their specific customers.
                        Since emergence of the ecommerce concept most of the university and non-university
                        researchers have followed number of research methodologies with integration of newest
                        technologies available to find out the best recommendation engine for product suggestions.
                        Their goal was to make the product recommendation platform more efficient and more
                        accurate. Even though the most of researches have been involved, they couldn’t come up with
                        the best solution for an efficient and accurate solution.</p>

                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-justify">Although there are several existing recommendation engines are available
                        for product recommendation, those are not addressed the solutions provided by our product
                        iRecommender. Our solution consists with many functionalities and features others do not have.
                        In this research our main target was to find a way to make hybrid recommendations and find a
                        way to overcome the cold start problem</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Most of researchers used one recommendation approach to predict the customer
                        tastes. Then we found that the most of the time that test predictions are not feasible and
                        accurately personalized for each specific user, Because of lack of using the recommendation
                        methodologies and technologies. And in here we have found out many of the researchers are
                        continuously trying, to make a solution for overcome the Cold Start problem. researchers
                        suggest deep learning, content based recommendation, Comparing product specifications
                        etc. And the other serious problem we found the response time of recommendation engine is very
                        high because most of the recommendation engines use relational databases as their knowledge
                        base. Even though those methods and technologies are used to overcome the Cold Start problem,
                        the Cold Start problem is still there in the ecommerce websites. And we found that the
                        personalized recommending accuracy is not best at most of the e commerce web sites. So to
                        address the Cold Start, scalability, availability, high response time and Low personalized
                        recommending accuracy rate problems we developed the product called iRecommender. Following
                        table 1 shows what are the major differences between our product and existing products</p>

                    <hr class="primary">
                    <p class="text-justify">There are several methods on suggesting products to the users of ecommerce
                        websites. But almost all of them are making their suggestions based on one recommendation engine
                        approach either collaborative based filtering or content based filtering. When new users
                        register with the ecommerce platform the websites don’t have any suggestions to the newly
                        registered users. Then the newly registered users get generalized recommendations until they
                        buy something from the e commerce website. As this is an inefficient method, users are not
                        getting the exact product suggestions. The failure of product suggestions on an ecommerce
                        website leads to more issues. Users tend to use ecommerce to save their time. As suggestions
                        are failed, users will have to search again and again for products. Sometimes the users have
                        no idea on which keywords to search. By taking in to consideration above issues, the impression
                        that users have on the website are getting reduced. This will lead to decrement in sales on the
                        site.</p>
